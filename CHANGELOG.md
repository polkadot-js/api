**Important** In the 4.0 version the default package type has been changed to ESM modules by default. This should not affect usage, however since the output formats changed, a new major version is required.

Contributed:

- Expose `unknownTypes` on the registry interface (Thanks to https://github.com/ii-ii-ii)

Changes:

- Build to ESM by default (with cjs versions via export map)
- Enum `.toSON()` now encodes all keys as `camelCase` (aligning with the output from Substrate)
- Add `createdAtHash?: Hash` to `Codec` interface (filled-in by storage retrievals)
- Expose the source hash as `wamHash` on Abi parsed instances
- Use `parentHash` when creating mortal era (handles frequent forks better)
- Add `AccountInfoWithTripleRefCount` to cater for latest Substrate
- Add upgrade block for Westend 49


## 3.11.1 Feb 28, 2021

## 3.10.2 Feb 23, 2021

Upgrade priority: Medium. Recommended for users of chains where `MultiAddress` is in-use and blocks are decoded.

Changes:

- Fix decoding for `MultiAddress` enum where non-`AccountId` variable-lengths are provided as part of a stream
- Added known Polkadot 28 upgrade block
- Update for latest Substrate contracts `Schedule` types


## 3.10.1 Feb 22, 2021

Upgrade priority: Low.

Changes:

- Adjust ConsumedWeight types to align with Rust module code
- Check for connection status in subscription unsubscribe
- Adjust staking reward derives ordering for better performance
- Adapt detection imports to remove `.json` dependencies (Better behavior using Node.js with ESM)


## 3.9.3 Feb 16, 2021

Upgrade priority: Low. Recommended for parachain builders since it contains the updated parachain types.

Changes:

- Adjusted parachain `PersistedValidationData` structure


## 3.9.2 Feb 15, 2021

Upgrade priority: Low. Recommended for parachain builders since it contains the latest parachain types.

Contributed:

- Update README links (Thanks to https://github.com/wirednkod)

Changes:

- Added missing Culmulus `ParachainInherentData` & `MessageQueueChain` types
- Add alias for `system_unstable_networkState` RPC


## 3.9.1 Feb 14, 2021

Upgrade priority: Low.

- **Important** The `Result<T, E>` has been updated in the generation and the base types to follow the Rust version 100%. This means `{as, is}Error` is now available as `{as, is}Err` on the `Result` type. The older versions can still be used, but the `*Error` interfaces are now marked as deprecated.

Changes:

- Adjust `Result<T, E>` interface to be 100% compatible with the Rust version
- Add the `2028` upgrade to the known upgrades (optimizing certain `.at` queries)
- Adjust council derives to cater for latest Substrate & Polkadot

- Update types for latest Polkadot/Substrate
- Add generic arguments for TypeScript users to `.entries/.keys` to deal with the key typings


## 3.8.1 Feb 7, 2021

Upgrade priority: Low. Recommended for users of the latest Substrate master, especially using contracts.

- **Important** The `api-contract` `Code` now supports deploying the code and a contract in on operation. This aligns with the latest Substrate where code cannot be uploaded with a contract. The `createBlueprint` is therefore deprecated, use `code.tx.<constructor>(...)` to deploy code. (Compatible with both old and new versions of Substrate)

Contributed:

- Add support for latest Frontier RPCs (Thanks to https://github.com/jnaviask)
- Fix user-supplied signed extensions type signature (Thanks to https://github.com/ntduan)

Changes:

- Expand `api-contract` to allow for `Code` to deploy contract alongside code. `createBlueprint` is now deprecated, replaced by `createContract` or the preferred `code.tx.<constructor>`, which uploads and deploys the code in one operation. This aligns with the current Substrate master contracts implementation.
- Allow for signed extensions to be supplied inside type bundles
- Ensure that the auto-connect state is checked on auto-connections (respecting disconnect)
- Added `CancelProxy` to `ProxyTypes on Polkadot, Kusama & Westend
- Updated to latest Substrate metadata


## 3.7.3 Feb 2, 2021

Changes:

- Added Polkadot upgrade block for runtime 27 (known checkpoint optimization)


## 3.7.2 Feb 2, 2021

Changes:

- Adjusted the `Keys` type for the 28 runtime on Kusama, Polkadot & Westend


## 3.7.1 Feb 1, 2021

Upgrade priority: Low. However recommended for current Substrate master, Polkadot and Rococo users and those wishing to support the upcoming Polkadot 28 runtime with the new `MultiAddress`.

- **Breaking change** As indicated in the 3.5.1 release notes, the `Address`/`LookupSource` defaults have now been adjusted for `MultiAddress`. If your chain does not use these types, explicitly add the correct `Address`/`LookupSource` types. This new extensible format is mean to cater for all address types into the future, removing a lot of discrepancies between chains.

Contributed:

- Extraction of the block author on Moonbeam (Thanks to https://github.com/joelamouche)
- Cleanup logs with HTTP providers, no subs (Thanks to https://github.com/Tbaut)

Changes:

- Allow `.slice` operator on the `Vec` type

- Adds support for the upcoming Polkadot 28 and Kusama 2028 runtimes
- Add checkpoint for Kusama 2027 upgrade
- Update all parachain types (as per latest Rococo)
- Correctly use relay blockNumber in parachain validation data
- remove information log for capabilities detection (creates confusion)
- Remove explicit references to `global`, use the `x-global` detection
- Remove explicit `module` in `package.json` (exports map available)


## 3.6.1 Jan 24, 2020

Upgrade priority: Medium if not already on at least 3.3.1. The next upgrade of Kusama/Polkadot requires it.

- **Breaking change** To support chains with multiple tokens, such as bridges, the `ChainProperties` type now returns an array of tokens and decimals (instead of singular values) in the `token{Decimals, Symbol}` getters. Additionally, this means that the `registry` interfaces has been changes, to `registry.chainDecimals: number[]` and `registry.chainTokens: string[]`. Where used the `[0]` index will return the first value if only interested in a single, for a straight conversion.

Changes:

- Allow for the detection of on-chain capabilities as available (e.g. `AccountData`, `ValidatorPrefs`)
- Cater for multiple tokens and decimals in the chain the chain `system.properties` (as per the chain specification)
- Add a `instances: { [key]: [module1, module2] }` definition in teh bundle types, allowing for multiple instances (e.g. Balances)
- Adjust the `api-derive` for balances to retrieve values via `instances` as well as across multiple modules
- Ensure all types are registered for all metadata typegen steps
- Add `rpc.payment.queryFeeDetails` RPC endpoint
- Update types & metadata to latest Substrate
- Move the `@polkadot/x-rxjs` package into the common repo
- Allow doc generation for errors/events (markdown outputs)


## 3.5.1 Jan 18, 2020

Upgrade priority: Low. Recommended for parachain developers.

- **Important** The default for Substrate on the Address types are `MultiAddress`. It is recommended that chains add explicit definitions for `Address` and `LookupSource` in their types, instead of relying on the API-defaults. A future update will swap the API defaults to align with Substrate.
- **Important** Like the above changes in Substrate, the `AccountInfo` structure has also changed. It is recommended that chain developers explicitly add `AccountInfo: 'AccountInfoWithRefCount'` for the version with `refCount` on and `AccountInfoWithProviders` for the latest Substrate version. As per the above, the API defaults will be changed to align with Substrate.

Contributed:

- Apply correct TypeScript type for `toBigInt()` (Thanks to https://github.com/ianhe8x)
- Expand type definitions for storage key tuples (Thanks to https://github.com/monitz87)

## 3.4.1 Jan 11, 2020

Upgrade priority: Low. Fixes for parachain types, `.entries()` (with no values) and `event.is(...)` checks, users of these interfaces will have benefit.

- **Breaking change** The `derive.chain.{getBlock, subscribeNewBlocks}` now return `SignedBlockExtended`, all with the actual extrinsics and events mapped. Users of the latter interface should take note.

- Fix `SessionKeys{6-9}` definitions (Thanks to https://github.com/icodezjb)
- Support `Vec<(a, b)>` in enums (Thanks to https://github.com/monitz87)
- Add motions to bounty derive (Thanks to https://github.com/ekowalsk)

Changes:

- `derive.chain.getBlock()` now maps events to extrinsics via `.extrinsics` getter
- Ensure dispatchInfo is extracted on failed extrinsics (`getBlock` derive)

## 3.0.1 Dec 14, 2020

Upgrade priority: Low. Recommended for the next Kusama/Polkadot upgrades due to additional types and those following chains following Substrate master closely.

**Important** While this package contains no external interface changes, it now compiles and ships both cjs and esm modules. This means that modern bundlers will have more information for tree-shaking available. Additionally when using Node with `.mjs` extensions, the esm version imports will be used on recent Node versions. Adding an export map, as here, may have some impacts so a major semver bump is advised. There may be (small) dragons hiding in the dark corners...

Contributed:

- Injection of derives via typesBundle (Thanks to https://github.com/pr0fedt)
- Added derives for bounties (Thanks to https://github.com/krzysztof-jelski)

Upgrade priority: Low. Recommended when following Substrate master and/or parachains development, contains the latest types for both.

- **Breaking change** If using the `staking.query` derive, you now need to pass flags as to which values to retrieve

Changes:

- Ensure that maximum era is limited to `consts.system.blockHashCount` (don't overflow on very low blocktimes)
- Apply current Polkadot master parachain types
- Apply current Substrate master asset types
- Add `system_{addLogFilter, resetLogFilter}` RPCs
- Adjust tests for latest Substrate metadata
- Adjust staking derives to be more performant (flags indicate which query values to retrieve)
- Add account derive to cater for the availability of identities
- Use `import type` in all cases


## 2.9.1 Nov 30, 2020

Upgrade priority: Low. No major changes when on at least 2.8.2. Users encouraged to upgrade to at least that patch.

- **Breaking change** The API will now not attempt to queue calls made while not connected and send on connection. Rather when making a call and the RPC node is not connected, an error will be thrown.

Contributed:

- Add typegen capability for custom RPCs (Thanks to https://github.com/holygits)

Changes:

- Remove rpc-core send queue, only allow sends while connected
- Adjust staking derive for `electedInfo` to contain details of current validators
- Extract identity-only derive from `accounts.info` for simpler reusability
- Add types for Substrate master node (to allow for consistent swapping to `MultiAddress`)

## 2.5.1 Nov 2, 2020

Upgrade priority: Low. Recommended for `api-contract` developers.

- **Breaking change** Substrate changed the `ContractExecResult` from `api.rpc.contracts.call`. The API does have pass-through support for both old and new variants via the `Contract` interface, however it means the structure has changed to accommodate the new Substrate structure. Refer to the [docs for the latest interface](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api-contract/start/contract.read) (including `isSuccess/isError` -> `isOk/isErr`, and the availability of the `gasConsumed`)

Contributed:

## 2.2.1 Oct 12, 2020

Upgrade priority: Low.

- **Breaking change** `@polkadot/api-contract` now only supports ink! 3.0-rc1 and later formats. Users of ink! 2.1 are recommended to stay on an older version until upgraded.

Contributed:

- Add latest Ink! types (Thanks to https://github.com/ascjones & https://github.com/kwingram25)

- Bump Substrate metadata (tests, doc generation)


## 2.0.1 Sep 28, 2020

Upgrade priority: Medium. Required for all teams building on Substrate 2.0 for full compatibility.

- **Important** The `RefCount` type (used by `query.system.accounts`) has been changed to a `u32`. On older chains supply the `RefCount: 'RefCountTo259'` override
- **Breaking change** Metadata versions before v9 as not supported anymore. v4 was the first version to go with the Substrate 1.0 while Kusama itself starts at v9 as the earliest version. This means that Substrate 1.x chains that have not had any upgrades are not supported in this version of the API anymore.
- **Breaking change** Extrinsic versions before v4 (1-3) are not supported anymore. This aligns with the above metadata change, where v4 is the canonical version.
- **Breaking change** Support for the old-style linked-map retrievals via `query.<module>.map()` have been dropped, only the existing `.keys()/.entries()` are available for map iteration.

Contributed:

- Adjust `RefCount` type as per substrate 2.0
- Add `PalletVersion` types for future palette versioning
- Adjust formatting for `Per{cent, bill, mill}` without instance checks
- Skip invalid keys on validator retrievals


## 1.34.1 Sep 21, 2020

Upgrade priority: High. Metadata v12 is the next major version containing structural data exchange changes and will start rolling out to test and live networks in due course.

- **Breaking change** The `Decorated` (from `@polkadot/metadata`) class signature has changed. It now always expects a valid `Metadata` object to be passed-in, instead of raw data. It is recommended to create a `Metadata` object, set it on the registry with `.setMetadata` and then only create a `Decorated` instance. (Only affects metadata-only users of the API)

Contributed:

- Added support for POW block author extraction (Thanks to https://github.com/sorpaas)

Changes:

- Ensure Metadata retrieval does not pollute the default registry
- When passing `{ nonce: -1 }` to `signAndSend` the API will use `system.accountNextIndex` to determine the nonce
- Ensure that upgrades override old registry types (non-specified in current)
- Support for Metadata v12 with fixed indices
- Cleanups for WebSocket class detection and creation
- Ensure that ignored map params yield an error on `iterKey`

Upgrade priority: Low. Recommended when using clones instances.

Changes:

- Allow `paymentInfo` on any extrinsic with `tx.paymentInfo(<address>, <at>)` (hash specified)
- When cloning an API instance the runtimeChain is now properly set from source
- When cloning an API instance the registry is shared with the source
- Optimize derive `receivedHeartbeats` to not re-create the full object
- Add `staking.stakerPrefs` derive to retrieve validatorPrefs over a range of eras
- Basic map of Websocket error codes to short descriptions (where none available)


## 1.32.1 Sep 7, 2020

Upgrade priority: Low. Recommended when manually using provider connect/disconnect or using multiple instances in a single process.

- **Breaking change** Previously `.isReady` could throw an error, now it will always succeed on connection. For trapping errors, use the `.isReadyOrError` variant on the API
- **Breaking change** The `isConnected` provider interface is now a getter, replacing previous calls to `provider.isConnected()`. Additionally the `provider.disconnect()` is now async, aligning with `.connect()`.

Contributed:

- Expand vesting information via derive balances (Thanks to https://github.com/niklabh)
- Add `isReadyOrError` to API, `isReady` always succeeds (Thanks to https://github.com/shawntabrizi)

Changes:

- Adjust memoization to work on a per-instance basis, with no contamination between multiple api/provider instances
- Added `derive.chain.getBlock(hash)` to retrieve a `SignedBlock` extended with an `.author` (same as `derive.chain.getHeader(...)`)
- Added `api.{connect, disconnect}()` as well as `isConnected` interfaces. The first functions async returning `Promise<void>`
- Error on provider connections will now emit all (as expected) via the event emitter
- Ensure that initial connection failures always retry (when using auto-connection management)
- The `api.derive.staking.query/queryMulti` no longer retrieves session keys (can be done via `.keys/keysMulti`)
- Add `api.derive.accounts.accountId` to perform AccountId lookups (from indices or actual AccountId)
- Lessen load of `paymentInfo` queries to only use accounId mappings as available
- Adjust staking derives to cater for early Substrate 2.0 chains (optional/non-optional EraIndexes)
- Cater for the handling of nested aliased types, e.g. wrapped inside Vec or Tuple
- Add the support for the `grandpa_subscribeJustifications` RPC

- Static metadata & tests updated for the latest substrate master
- `toHuman()` & `.toBigInt()` has been explicitly added to the API documentation
- Adjust known types for latest Kusama network state


## 1.31.1 Aug 31, 2020

Upgrade priority: Medium, especially for staking users on Polkadot, Kusama & Westend (type updates applied for v23 onwards) or if transparent `.at(hash)` queries are required/used

- **Important** Substrate changed the `RewardDestination` enum with an extra field for payout-to-any account for staking preferences. If on an older chain consider adding `RewardDestination: 'RewardDestinationTo257'`
- **Important** Substrate changed the `CompactAssignment` type enhanced types for session solution submissions. If on an older chain consider adding `CompactAssignments: 'CompactAssignmentsTo257'`

Contributed:

- Fix documentation language and typos (Thanks to https://github.com/Meuko)
- Add missing `TransactionPriority` type (Thanks to https://github.com/aniiantt)
- Update definitions for new `CompactAssignments`, including tests (Thanks to https://github.com/kianenigma)

- Adjust types for `CompactAssignments` & `RewardDestination` for Polkadot, Kusama & Westend
- `@polkadot/util` 3.4
- `@polkadot/wasm-crypto` 1.4

## 1.7.1 Mar 17, 2020

- **Important** Current versions of Polkadot/Substrate have dropped support for linked maps on storage entries. If you are using these queries to retrieve all entries, for instance `staking.{nominators,validators}()` and using an upgraded chain, you need to swap to retrieving entries via `.entries()` or `.keys()` for the keys.

## 1.6.1 Mar 12, 2020

- **Breaking change** `api.rpc.state.queryStorage(...)` now fully decodes the `Vec<StorageChangeSet>` and returns a decoded `[Hash, Codec[]][]` when using this RPC.

Changes:

- `StorageKey` now has an `.args` property, decoded from meta where `twox64_concat` or `blake128_concat` are used on maps
- Fix `api.query.*.*.entries` type conversions to return exact types (not `Option` in some cases)
- Add `api.query.*.*.keys` to retrieve only the storage keys, similar to `.entries`
- Full linked map retrievals will now use direct getStorage queries for faster operation
- Underlying rpc-core interfaces now unwraps `Error("...")` when found in responses

- `Bool` will now correctly return `isEmpty` on false/default values
- Refresh the `NetworkState` types as returned by the `rpc.system.networkState()` call to current
- Expose `registry.createClass(<typeName>)` to allow for creating type classes. If you are using `createClass` or `ClassOf` in your code, it is recommended to swap to this instance.

- `UInt` & `Int` now does source bitLength checks upon construction
- Registry now exposes `.createType(<type>, ...args)` as an additional helper (like the API)
- Expand `.toHuman` on `ExtrinsicEra`, `SubmittableResult` & `Vote`

If you explicitly create `Metadata` classes, you now would need to do so with the `import Metadata from '@polkadot/metadata';` This is a decorated class, where the previous metadata is now available on `Metadata.metadata`, alongside decorated `consts.*`', `tx.*` and `query.*`.
- **Breaking change** Session `Keys` defaults to 4 keys now (Substrate master), depending on your node config, you would want to override with e.g. `Keys: 'SessionKeys3'` (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6)
- **Breaking change** `ValidatorPrefs` now default to the new percentage commission model, to use the previous `validatorPayment`, you can override with `ValidatorPrefs: 'ValidatorPrefsTo196'`

Changes:

- `api.derive.*` now has built-in memomization
- Various fixes and cleanups to `api.derive.*` including era length progress and vesting calculations
- Aligned all types with the latest Polkadot & Substrate, including Kusama CC3
- Support for Metadata V9, which adjusts the hashing methods of storage entries
- Support for Metadata V10 (still un-released), which includes prefixed map support


## 0.96.1 Nov 09, 2019

Changes:

- Updated types for latest Kusama
- Add `filterRecords` (in addition to `findRecord`) on submittable results
- Various ABI v2 contract fixes
- Update derive for elections (incl. RunnersUp) and heartbeat derives (with blocks & messages)
- Add vesting totals & locked breakdowns to derive balances
- Update council derives for the latest Substrate master support (with constants)
- Derive cleanups, including sharing of instances between the API and internal to derives


## 0.95.2 Oct 25, 2019

Changes:

- Temporary removal of `account_nextIndex` use, will be re-added in a future release


## 0.95.1 Oct 25, 2019

- **Breaking change** `Call.injectMethods` is moved to `Call.injectMetadata` to align with `Events` (This _should_ not be used externally, however mentioned as breaking here)

Changes:

- Support Extrinsic V4 with additional signature indicator (Latest Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama)
- Adjust subscription update checks to avoid duplicated data updates
- Support Metadata V8 (exposes per-module `decl_error` definitions)
- Support next generation contracts ABI (with additional type definitions)
- Support for `BTreeMap<K, V>` types and definitions
- All latest Polkadot & Substrate types (as per master branches)

## 0.94.1 Oct 07, 2019

Changes:

- Add handling of `Result<Ok, Error>` definitions
- Adjust API cloning now takes RPC filters from source into account
- Simplification of isPedantic checks and less overhead on StorageData types
- Cleanups and fixes around RPC and derive type definitions
- Fix `derive.imOnline.receivedHeartbeats` to query via indexes
- Adjustment of `api.derive.elections.{approvalsOf|approvalsOfAt}` to allow ss58 address input
- Cleanup `Enum` `.eq` handling to be more exhaustive
- Add documentation for custom extrinsic formats (advanced chains)
- Update to latest substrate master metadata


## 0.93.1 Sep 26, 2019

Changes:

- Support for Kusama CC2
- In extrinsic submission, use `rpc.account.nextIndex` to retrieve the nonce when available
- For TypeScript users `api.query.*.*` is now properly typed for default Substrate calls, i.e. `api.query.balances.freeBalance(...)` will return a `Balance` type. Additionally the `api.queryMulti` and `.multi` on queries not allow generic type params.
- Add `api.rpc.accounts.nextIndex`, `api.rpc.contracts.call` and `api.rpc.rpc.methods` calls. Optional calls (such as account/contracts) is decorated based on the results from `rpc.methods`, so they don't show up on nodes where they are not active.
- Updated types to support the latest Polkadot/Substrate master changes
- Support recursive type registration (self-referencing via `Box`) in addition to better sanitation of user-defined-types
- Documentation and example updates (thanks mostly to contributions)


## 0.92.1 Sep 12, 2019

Changes:

- The API now correctly sets the ss58 prefix as retrieved from the chain properties via `ss58Format`
- Bump to `@polkadot/util` 1.4.1, removing use of `ExtError`
- The `Keyring` from `@polkadot/keyring` is now exposed on the API as well. You can do `import { Keyring } from '@polkadot/api'` - this alleviates the need for extra dependencies (apart from `@polkadot/api`), and since the keyring is critical for signing operations, aligns everything in one bundle
- Support the latest Polkadot & Substrate master branches (incl. metadata updates)
- Getting started documentation has been made available


## 0.91.1 Sep 09, 2019

Changes:

- This release was focussed on stability, with a number of cleanups and bug-fixes
- Adjustments for Substrate 1.x chain detection (with auto-types) and Substrate 2.x support has been extended with all latest types
- The `getRuntimeVersion` and `subscribeRuntimeVersion` RPCs are now only available on the `rpc.state.*` endpoints. This aligns with the Substrate implementation.
- The `author_insertKey` RPC's last argument `publicKey` is now required, as to reflect Substrate implementation.
- Support for extrinsics with versions that is not in the base Substrate implementation (V1-V3) can now be done by providing an implementation for `ExtrinsicUnknown`
- Redeemed balance calculation if `api.derive` now returns the correct  values again (bug fix)
- added the `yarn chain:info [--ws URL]` utility to extract a calls-only metadata version
- Missing types are now logged via a `console.warn`, not via `.error`
- `Extrinsic`, `ExtrinsicPayload` & `SignerPayload` is registered in the type registry and can be overridden now
  - **Breaking change** `SignerPayload` is renamed to `SignerPayloadJSON`
  - **Breaking change** `SignerPayloadJSON`, `SignerPayloadRawBase` and `SignerPayloadRaw` are all moved to `@polkadot/types`


## 0.90.1 Aug 24, 2019

If you are upgrading form an older version, use the CHANGELOG hand-in-hand with the [migration guide](UPGRADING.md).

- **Breaking change** `api.rpc.chain.subscribeNewHeads` is now available as opposed to the old `subscribeNewHead`. This aligns with the Substrate implementation.
- **Breaking change** Substrate 2.x & Polkadot master has moved both `BlockNumber` & `Index` to `u32`. The API tracks these closely. If you are running a chain with `u64` values (for either), pass the type override to the API on creation, e.g. `ApiPromise.create({ types: { BlockNumber: 'u64', Index: 'u64' } })` to avoid getting warnings about mismatched types.
- **Breaking change** `Api.create(...)` and `new Api(...)` now only takes an options Object, so if you passed the provider directly previously, you need to swap the use to `Api.create({ provider: ... })`
- **Breaking change** Runtime types have been extended and moved to definitions instead of classes
  - Primitive types for `i*` and `u*` (e.g. `u32`) are now only available in their lowercase versions. Additionally `Vector` is now only available as `Vec`, and `Method` has been renamed to `Call`, in both cases aligning with Rust.
  - `Moment` now implements as `u64` as per the Substrate codebase. (It it up to the user to interpret, for substrate 2.x it is not ms resolution)
  - For creation of types, it is recommended to use `createType(<TypeName>, <value>)` instead of e.g. `new Proposal(...)`. When passing these to methods/queries, construction should not be needed, the raw value can be passed.
  - For moved types, a previous import would have been from `@polkadot/types`, i.e. `import { SetIndex } from '@polkadot/types`, now just the interfaces (TypeScript) are available via `import { SetIndex } from '@polkadot/types/interfaces`
  - `usize` is now a blacklisted type that will throw on construction. Since it is platform-specific, it creates incompatibilities between native (generally `u64`) and WASM (always `u32`) code. Use one of the `u32` or `u64` types explicitly.

Changes:

- Support substrate v7 metadata
- The `Method.findFunction(callIndex)` (allowing decoding of raw data), is now available on `api.findCall(callIndex)`. To keep backwards compatibility, it is still available on `GenericCall.findMethod` but the `api.findCall` is recommended and suggested.
- The `types/codec/createType` has been moved to `types/codec/create` with the same exports. If you explicitly imported from here (and not doing the suggested `import { createType } from '@polkadot/types`), the reference needs to be updated


## 0.82.0-beta.x Jul 28, 2019

Changes:

- Support for substrate 2.x (master) has been extended,
  - Additional types have been addedd for the modules
  - `api.derive.contract` is now `api.derive.contracts` to align with the substrate 2.x rename. (Feature detection is used so it supports both 1.x and 2.x chains)
  - Addition of `api.derive.elections`

- Support latest substrate 2 v6 metadata with module constants using `api.consts`.
  - The api now uses the module name for the storage methods, aligning module names for consistency with transactions. The methods of the grandpa module moved from `api.query.grandpaFinality` to `api.query.grandpa`.
  - Internally the `@polkadot/extrinsics` and `@polkadot/storage` have been moved to `@polkadot/api-metadata` and are now accessible as `@polkadot/api-metadata/extrinsics` and `@polkadot/api-metadata/storage`, respectively.
  - **Breaking Change** Vote interface extends U8a instead of i8. Vote properties can be accessed via the `isAye`, `isNay`, and `conviction` getters. Votes can still be constructed as before with a raw JS boolean, a SCALE encoded Boolean, an i8 number, or a JS object with properties `aye` and `conviction` defined.

- Support V2 Extrinsics in addition to V1, v2 includes an optional `tip`
  - In addition to this support, the `Signer` interface has deprecated the `sign` method and replaced it with `signPayload`
  - Support for the `sign` interfaces (API detection and calling when `signPayload` is not available) will be removed in subsequent versions.

- The `ContractsAbi` type has been moved from `@polkadot/types` to `import { Abi } from '@polkadot/api-contract`. This paves the way for an enhanced contracts interface, instead of dealing with low-level API calls.


## 0.81.1 Jun 14, 2019

Changes:

- The dependency on `@polkadot/keyring` has been removed - if you relied on the API to provide this, you would now need to manually add it
- `createType` allows for the creation of `[u8; <length>]` types (opening the door for contract support)
- `api.derive.staking.info` now returns the `rewardDestination`
- Fix for disconnection when default providers (non-specified) are used
- Don't console.log type decoding errors and then throw, only re-throw with additional info
- Support latest substrate 2.x v5 metadata
  - Add `ApprovalFlag`, `SetIndex`, `VoterInfo` types for council as per substrate
  - Update `ContractInfo` to match substrate master

- Add support for new inherent digests from substrate.
  - **Breaking change** Because of the new `Seal`, the old/new Seals are not compatible. If you were using the old `Seal` from the `Digest`s, you would now use `isSealV0` for the pre-substrate 1.0 version and the new `isSeal` for the current version
  - Update `HeaderExtended` to retrieve author information from substrate 2.x (new `PreRuntime` digests)

- Cater for `Vec`, `Option`, `Result`, tuples and fixed vectors for contracts ABIs
- Additional examples for subscriptions using multi
- Add `off` method to `Api` (Base, for both `ApiPromise` & `ApiRx`) to remove an event listener


## 0.80.1 Jun 04, 2019

Changes:

- Support for mortal transactions
- Better DoubleMap storage support
- api-derive cleanups, including additional info for balances.all and taking.info returning redeemable and locked balances
- Added SignaturePayloadRaw for better offline signing support
- Updated metadata for current substrate master
- Misc. cleanups and fixes


## 0.79.1 May 22, 2019

Changes:

- DoubleMap query support
- Support latest EventRecord metadata (substrate master)
- Introduce RuntimeVersion type overrides in api/nodeCompat.ts
- Add `api.queryMulti` and `api.query.<module>.<method>.multi`
- Convert `api.derive.*` to use multi queries
- `types/codec/Set` now extends the base JS `Set` (**breaking change**: `set.values` -> `set.strings`)
- Breaking: rename `meta.arguments` to `meta.args` in function metadata (`arguments` is a JS reserved word)
- Add `toRawType` on all type classes (breakdown into primitive types)


## 0.78.1 May 08, 2019

Changes:

- Fix linked-maps (not working since 0.77.1)
- Convert Usize to U32 (as found in WASM environments)
- Allow pre-bundled metadata in API create & constructor
- Don't clobber existing keys in structs when auto-adding fields
- Additional logging when constructing Structs as to where failures occur
- Do type assertion on all exposed asXXX getters
- Metadata updates for substrate (WithdrawReasons, ContractInfo)


## 0.77.1 Apr 25, 2019

Changes:

- Support Metadata v4, which introduces the use of a custom hasher to hash storage map keys.
- Add TreasuryProposal (not the same as democracy, type aliased)


## 0.76.1 Apr 03, 2019

Changes:

- Caching improvements (duplicate queries, no duplicate subscriptions)
- Experimental contract API
- Update @polkadot/keyring to enable Alice's stash account on dev chains
- Update @polkadot/util-crypto with smaller footprint


## 0.75.1 Mar 29, 2019

Changes:

- Start journey to 1.0


## 0.53.1 Mar 29, 2019

Changes:

- Change spelling to US English as per substrate master (1.0-rc1). Breaking changes as a result:
  - For extrinsic status results, if you have checked the type returns, i.e. `result.type === 'Finalised'` now check on the status for `result.status.isFinalized` or `result.status.isBroadcast`, ... (the `type` property is now accessible only on `result.status.type`)
  - If using `subscribeFinalisedHeads` update this to `subscribeFinalizedHeads` (likewise `getFinalisedHead` should be updated to `getFinalizedHead` and `derive.bestNumberFinalized`)
- The underlying ss58 address checksums have changed
  - The updated keyring with support for this has been made available
  - All examples have been updated with sr25519 addresses (with the new checksums)


## 0.52.1 Mar 28, 2019

Changes:

- Support queries to linked mapped storage (found in new staking interfaces)
- Add `derive.staking.controllers` to retrieve all active staking controllers
- Align types as per latest substrate master
- PeerInfo from system_peers does not have the index field anymore (dropped in substrate)
- Allow parsing of V3 metadata with DoubleMap support
- Check for single instances for api and types as they are loaded (assertSingletonPackage)


## 0.51.1 Mar 25, 2019

Changes:

- Support metadata V2 as per latest substrate master
- Update metadata with new types as per latest substrate master


## 0.50.1 Mar 23, 2019

Changes:

- Latest util-crypto (usage of WASM with JS fallbacks if not available)
- Update upstream @polkadot dependencies (for new crypto)


## 0.49.1 Mar 20, 2019

Changes:

- Fix large message signing on non-known nodes (default is now hashing, there has been enough time between upgrades)


## 0.48.1 Mar 18, 2019

Changes:

- Pull in new sr25519 capable keyring for dev nodes
- When using dev mode, it assumes that the node is the latest with derived sr25519 keys


## 0.47.1 Mar 14, 2019

Changes:

- Swap to publishing -beta.x on merge (non-breaking testing)


## 0.46.1 Mar 01, 2019

Changes:

- Extended type registration to now handle internal types as well. Additionally the built-in Extrinsic type can now we overridden with a custom version.
- Where `Extrinsic` and `Method` is used as types, consider importing `{ IMethod, IExtrinsic }` from `@polkadot/types/types`, especially in the cases where this is used from a `SubmittableExtrinsic`
- The `typeRegistry` constant is now `getTypeRegistry()` as a function


## 0.45.1 Feb 19, 2019

Changes:

- Storage with option values now correctly return `Option<Type>` and is indicated as such in the documentation

```js
// old
const ll = await api.query.session.lastLengthChange();

console.log('ll', ll /* BlockNumber */); // would be 0 if not set yet

// new
const llo = await api.query.session.lastLengthChange();

console.log('llo', llo.unwrapOr('not set') /* Option<BlockNumber> */)
```


## 0.44.1 Feb 19, 2019

Changes:

- Split primitives and types into separate folders. This should not affect external use since the exports remain the same, however does have an impact where classes are referenced directly. e.g.

```js
// old (affected)
import Method from '@polkadot/types/Method';
import Signature from '@polkadot/types/Signature';

// new locations
import Method from '@polkadot/types/primitive/Method';
import Signature from '@polkadot/types/type/Signature';

// unaffected
import { Method, Signature } from '@polkadot/types';
```


## 0.43.1 Feb 14, 2019

Changes:

- Introduces support for the new keyring with sr25519 support in addition to ed25519. While this does not change the exposed API, it is considered breaking since @polkadot/keyring has interface changes. (Unless needed, don't rush the upgrade)


## 0.42.1 Jan 31, 2019

Changes:

- Support for substrate hash signing with implVersion >= 18
- Changed signatures for Extrinsic signing, this should not have (much) of an impact since it is generally not used directly. SubmittableExtrinsic (as exposed by the API), supports the old-style use.


## 0.41.1 Jan 26, 2019

Changes:

- Support the V1 metadata specification from Substrate in addition to the currently testnet active V0 version


## 0.40.1 Jan 16, 2019

Changes:

- The API interfaces now require a WS-compatible provider, e.g. subscription support is a must. Previously the HTTPProvider could be use (although it was very limited in the interactions).


## 0.39.1 Jan 11, 2019

Changes:

- The Promise API now returns a `Promise<UnsubFunction>` instead of `UnsubFunction` when making subscriptions.


## 0.38.1 Jan 08, 2019

Changes:

Substrate has been updated with a breaking new transaction format where the Index/Nonce is now encoded as a Compact. This change is being rolled out to both Alexander (Polkadot testnet) as well as Charred Cherry (Substrate testnet) - transactions between old and new are not compatible.


## 0.37.1 Jan 04, 2019

Changes:

api-observable has been removed. This was only used in /apps and inconsistent with the api/rx and api/promise APIs. Future work will include derives like was included in api-observable into the base.

Tuples now return single types when only one type is available, i.e. `(AccountId)` would now resolve as `AccountId`. The extra type wrapper adds no benefit to users here.


## 0.36.1 Jan 03, 2019

Changes:

Api Promise has been updated in the way we deal with subscriptions. Previously a subscription returned `Promise<number>` where the caller was to keep track of the id and use it in subsequent unsubscribes. Now any subscriptions return an unsubscribe/destroy function `(): void`, that is use for removing the subscriptions, e.g.

```js
const unsubscribe = api.query.balance.freeBalance(Alice, (balance) => {...});

unsubscribe(); // here we destroy the subscription
```


## 0.35.1 Dec 20, 2018

Changes:

Swapped to new metadata structures from Substrate. If the API is not working with your node, update Substrate to latest master branch. (Or 0.9.1 for Charred Cherry). Dropped support for old metadata as found as far back as BBQ Birch.


## 0.34.1 Dec 18, 2018

Changes:

Changed the send signature (for future expansion of eg. events) to return `result: { status: ExtrinsicStatus }` instead of `status: ExtrinsicStatus`. For most cases where only status `type` checks are used, i.e. `status.type === 'Finalised'` this should not be a breaking change. Deep inspection of the status object however will need to adapt.
