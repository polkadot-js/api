### balances

▸ **setBalance**(who: `Address`, free: `Compact<Balance>`, reserved: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **summary**:   Set the balances of a given account.   This will alter `FreeBalance` and `ReservedBalance` in storage.  If the new free or reserved balance is below the existential deposit,  it will also decrease the total issuance of the system (`TotalIssuance`)  and reset the account nonce (`system::AccountNonce`).   The dispatch origin for this call is `root`.

▸ **transfer**(dest: `Address`, value: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **summary**:   Transfer some liquid free balance to another account.   `transfer` will set the `FreeBalance` of the sender and receiver.  It will decrease the total issuance of the system by the `TransferFee`.  If the sender's account is below the existential deposit as a result  of the transfer, the account will be reaped.   The dispatch origin for this call must be `Signed` by the transactor.

___


### consensus

▸ **killStorage**(keys: `Vec<Key>`)
- **summary**:   Kill some items from storage.

▸ **noteOffline**(offline: `InherentOfflineReport`)
- **summary**:   Note that the previous block's validator missed its opportunity to propose a block.

▸ **remark**(_remark: `Bytes`)
- **summary**:   Make some on-chain remark.

▸ **reportMisbehavior**(_report: `Bytes`)
- **summary**:   Report some misbehavior.

▸ **setCode**(new: `Bytes`)
- **summary**:   Set the new code.

▸ **setHeapPages**(pages: `u64`)
- **summary**:   Set the number of pages in the WebAssembly environment's heap.

▸ **setStorage**(items: `Vec<KeyValue>`)
- **summary**:   Set some items of storage.

___


### contract

▸ **call**(dest: `Address`, value: `Compact<BalanceOf>`, gas_limit: `Compact<Gas>`, data: `Bytes`)
- **summary**:   Makes a call to an account, optionally transferring some balance.   * If the account is a smart-contract account, the associated code will be  executed and any value will be transferred.  * If the account is a regular account, any value will be transferred.  * If no account exists and the call value is not less than `existential_deposit`,  a regular account will be created and any value will be transferred.

▸ **claimSurcharge**(dest: `AccountId`, aux_sender: `Option<AccountId>`)
- **summary**:   Allows block producers to claim a small reward for evicting a contract. If a block producer  fails to do so, a regular users will be allowed to claim the reward.   If contract is not evicted as a result of this call, no actions are taken and  the sender is not eligible for the reward.

▸ **create**(endowment: `Compact<BalanceOf>`, gas_limit: `Compact<Gas>`, code_hash: `CodeHash`, data: `Bytes`)
- **summary**:   Creates a new contract from the `codehash` generated by `put_code`, optionally transferring some balance.   Creation is executed as follows:   - The destination address is computed based on the sender and hash of the code.  - The smart-contract account is created at the computed address.  - The `ctor_code` is executed in the context of the newly-created account. Buffer returned    after the execution is saved as the `code` of the account. That code will be invoked    upon any call received by this account.  - The contract is initialized.

▸ **putCode**(gas_limit: `Compact<Gas>`, code: `Bytes`)
- **summary**:   Stores the given binary Wasm code into the chain's storage and returns its `codehash`.  You can instantiate contracts only with stored code.

▸ **restoreTo**(dest: `AccountId`, code_hash: `CodeHash`, rent_allowance: `BalanceOf`, delta: `Vec<ContractStorageKey>`)
- **summary**:   Allows a contract to restore a tombstone by giving its storage.   The contract that wants to restore (i.e. origin of the call, or `msg.sender` in Solidity terms) will compute a  tombstone with its storage and the given code_hash. If the computed tombstone  match the destination one, the destination contract is restored with the rent_allowance` specified,  while the origin sends all its funds to the destination and is removed.

▸ **updateSchedule**(schedule: `Schedule`)
- **summary**:   Updates the schedule for metering contracts.   The schedule must have a greater version than the stored schedule.

___

May be called by anyone. Returns the voter deposit to `signed`.

▸ **removeMember**(who: `Address`)
- **summary**:   Remove a particular member from the council. This is effective immediately.   Note: A tally should happen instantly (if not already in a presentation  period) to fill the seat if removal means that the desired members are not met.

▸ **retractVoter**(index: `Compact<u32>`)
- **summary**:   Remove a voter. All votes are cancelled and the voter deposit is returned.

▸ **setApprovals**(votes: `Vec<bool>`, index: `Compact<VoteIndex>`)
- **summary**:   Set candidate approvals. Approval slots stay valid as long as candidates in those slots  are registered.

▸ **setDesiredSeats**(count: `Compact<u32>`)
- **summary**:   Set the desired member count; if lower than the current count, then seats will not be up  election when they expire. If more, then a new vote will be started if one is not  already in progress.

▸ **unbond**(value: `Compact<BalanceOf>`)
- **summary**:   Schedule a portion of the stash to be unlocked ready for transfer out after the bond  period ends. If this leaves an amount actively bonded less than  T::Currency::existential_deposit(), then it is increased to the full amount.   Once the unlock period is done, you can call `withdraw_unbonded` to actually move  the funds out of management ready for transfer.   No more than a limited number of unlocking chunks (see `MAX_UNLOCKING_CHUNKS`)  can co-exists at the same time. In that case, [`Call::withdraw_unbonded`] need  to be called first to remove some of the chunks (if possible).   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash.   See also [`Call::withdraw_unbonded`].
