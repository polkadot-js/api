___


### balances

▸ **setBalance**(who: `Address`, free: `Compact<Balance>`, reserved: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **summary**:   Set the balances of a given account.   This will alter `FreeBalance` and `ReservedBalance` in storage.  If the new free or reserved balance is below the existential deposit,  it will also decrease the total issuance of the system (`TotalIssuance`)  and reset the account nonce (`system::AccountNonce`).   The dispatch origin for this call is `root`.

▸ **transfer**(dest: `Address`, value: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **summary**:   Transfer some liquid free balance to another account.   `transfer` will set the `FreeBalance` of the sender and receiver.  It will decrease the total issuance of the system by the `TransferFee`.  If the sender's account is below the existential deposit as a result  of the transfer, the account will be reaped.   The dispatch origin for this call must be `Signed` by the transactor.

___


### consensus

▸ **killStorage**(keys: `Vec<Key>`)
- **summary**:   Kill some items from storage.

### contract

▸ **call**(dest: `Address`, value: `Compact<BalanceOf>`, gas_limit: `Compact<Gas>`, data: `Bytes`)
- **summary**:   Makes a call to an account, optionally transferring some balance.   * If the account is a smart-contract account, the associated code will be  executed and any value will be transferred.  * If the account is a regular account, any value will be transferred.  * If no account exists and the call value is not less than `existential_deposit`,  a regular account will be created and any value will be transferred.

▸ **create**(endowment: `Compact<BalanceOf>`, gas_limit: `Compact<Gas>`, code_hash: `CodeHash`, data: `Bytes`)
- **summary**:   Creates a new contract from the `codehash` generated by `put_code`, optionally transferring some balance.   Creation is executed as follows:   - the destination address is computed based on the sender and hash of the code.  - the smart-contract account is created at the computed address.  - the `ctor_code` is executed in the context of the newly created account. Buffer returned    after the execution is saved as the `code` of the account. That code will be invoked    upon any call received by this account.  - The contract is initialized.

▸ **putCode**(gas_limit: `Compact<Gas>`, code: `Bytes`)
- **summary**:   Stores the given binary Wasm code into the chains storage and returns its `codehash`.  You can instantiate contracts only with stored code.

### council

May be called by anyone. Returns the voter deposit to `signed`.

▸ **removeMember**(who: `Address`)

- **summary**:   Set the presentation duration. If there is currently a vote being presented for, will  invoke `finalize_vote`.
