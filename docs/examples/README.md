# Examples

For the following examples, you need a local node. It is usually convenient testing with:

```
polkadot --dev
```

Some of the examples use the following accounts:

- Alice: `5GoKvZWG5ZPYL1WUovuHW3zJBWBP5eT8CbqjdRY4Q6iMaDtZ`
- Bob: `5Gw3s7q4QLkSWwknsiPtjujPv3XM4Trxi5d4PgKMMk3gfGTE`

Those accounts are easy to add if you don´t have/see them. The seed of Alice´s account is `Alice␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣` and the seed of Bob is... well you guess...

NOTE: Note the spaces padding Alice´s key up to 32 chars.

## Install

From each folder, run `yarn` to install the required dependencies

## Running the examples

```
