## balances

### forceTransfer(source: `Address`, dest: `Address`, value: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **interface**: api.tx.balances.forceTransfer
- **summary**: Exactly as `transfer`, except the origin must be root and the source account may be specified.

### setBalance(who: `Address`, new_free: `Compact<Balance>`, new_reserved: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **interface**: api.tx.balances.setBalance
- **summary**: Set the balances of a given account.  This will alter `FreeBalance` and `ReservedBalance` in storage. it will also decrease the total issuance of the system (`TotalIssuance`). If the new free or reserved balance is below the existential deposit, it will reset the account nonce (`system::AccountNonce`).  The dispatch origin for this call is `root`.  # <weight> - Independent of the arguments. - Contains a limited number of reads and writes. # </weight>

### transfer(dest: `Address`, value: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **interface**: api.tx.balances.transfer
- **summary**: Transfer some liquid free balance to another account.  `transfer` will set the `FreeBalance` of the sender and receiver. It will decrease the total issuance of the system by the `TransferFee`. If the sender's account is below the existential deposit as a result of the transfer, the account will be reaped.  The dispatch origin for this call must be `Signed` by the transactor.  # <weight> - Dependent on arguments but not critical, given proper implementations for input config types. See related functions below. - It contains a limited number of reads and writes internally and no complex computation.  Related functions:  - `ensure_can_withdraw` is always called internally but has a bounded complexity. - Transferring balances to accounts that did not exist before will cause `T::OnNewAccount::on_new_account` to be called. - Removing enough funds from an account will trigger `T::DustRemoval::on_unbalanced` and `T::OnFreeBalanceZero::on_free_balance_zero`. - `transfer_keep_alive` works the same way as `transfer`, but has an additional check that the transfer will not kill the origin account.  # </weight>

### transferKeepAlive(dest: `Address`, value: `Compact<Balance>`)
- **interface**: api.tx.balances.transferKeepAlive
- **summary**: Same as the [`transfer`] call, but with a check that the transfer will not kill the origin account.  99% of the time you want [`transfer`] instead.  [`transfer`]: struct.Module.html#method.transfer

Instantiation is executed as follows:  - The destination address is computed based on the sender and hash of the code. - The smart-contract account is created at the computed address. - The `ctor_code` is executed in the context of the newly-created account. Buffer returned after the execution is saved as the `code` of the account. That code will be invoked upon any call received by this account. - The contract is initialized.

### putCode(gas_limit: `Compact<Gas>`, code: `Bytes`)
- **interface**: api.tx.contracts.putCode

Once the unlock period is done, you can call `withdraw_unbonded` to actually move the funds out of management ready for transfer.  No more than a limited number of unlocking chunks (see `MAX_UNLOCKING_CHUNKS`) can co-exists at the same time. In that case, [`Call::withdraw_unbonded`] need to be called first to remove some of the chunks (if possible).  The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash.  See also [`Call::withdraw_unbonded`].  # <weight> - Independent of the arguments. Limited but potentially exploitable complexity. - Contains a limited number of reads. - Each call (requires the remainder of the bonded balance to be above `minimum_balance`) will cause a new entry to be inserted into a vector (`Ledger.unlocking`) kept in storage.

### withdrawUnbonded()
- **interface**: api.tx.staking.withdrawUnbonded
- **summary**: Remove any unlocked chunks from the `unlocking` queue from our management.  This essentially frees up that balance to be used by the stash account to do whatever it wants.  The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the controller, not the stash.  See also [`Call::unbond`].  # <weight> - Could be dependent on the `origin` argument and how much `unlocking` chunks exist. It implies `consolidate_unlocked` which loops over `Ledger.unlocking`, which is indirectly user-controlled. See [`unbond`] for more detail. - Contains a limited number of reads, yet the size of which could be large based on `ledger`. - Writes are limited to the `origin` account key. # </weight>
