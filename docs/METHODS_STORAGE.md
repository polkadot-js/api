### balances

▸ **creationFee**(): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The fee required to create an account.

▸ **existentialDeposit**(): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The minimum amount required to keep an account open.

▸ **freeBalance**(`AccountId`): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The 'free' balance of a given account.   This is the only balance that matters in terms of most operations on tokens. It  alone is used to determine the balance when in the contract execution environment. When this  balance falls below the value of `ExistentialDeposit`, then the 'current account' is  deleted: specifically `FreeBalance`. Further, the `OnFreeBalanceZero` callback  is invoked, giving a chance to external modules to clean up data associated with  the deleted account.   `system::AccountNonce` is also deleted if `ReservedBalance` is also zero (it also gets  collapsed to zero if it ever becomes less than `ExistentialDeposit`.

▸ **locks**(`AccountId`): `Vec<BalanceLock>`
- **summary**:   Any liquidity locks on some account balances.

▸ **reservedBalance**(`AccountId`): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The amount of the balance of a given account that is externally reserved; this can still get  slashed, but gets slashed last of all.   This balance is a 'reserve' balance that other subsystems use in order to set aside tokens  that are still 'owned' by the account holder, but which are suspendable.   When this balance falls below the value of `ExistentialDeposit`, then this 'reserve account'  is deleted: specifically, `ReservedBalance`.   `system::AccountNonce` is also deleted if `FreeBalance` is also zero (it also gets  collapsed to zero if it ever becomes less than `ExistentialDeposit`.)

▸ **totalIssuance**(): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The total units issued in the system.

▸ **transactionBaseFee**(): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The fee to be paid for making a transaction; the base.

▸ **transactionByteFee**(): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The fee to be paid for making a transaction; the per-byte portion.

▸ **transferFee**(): `Balance`
- **summary**:   The fee required to make a transfer.

- **summary**:   The amount of funds a contract should deposit in order to offset  the cost of one byte.   Let's suppose the deposit is 1,000 BU (balance units)/byte and the rent is 1 BU/byte/day,  then a contract with 1,000,000 BU that uses 1,000 bytes of storage would pay no rent.  But if the balance reduced to 500,000 BU and the storage stayed the same at 1,000,  then it would pay 500 BU/day.

This field is declared as double_map just  for convenience of using `remove_prefix`.   All topic vectors have deterministic storage locations depending on the topic. This  allows light-clients to leverage the changes trie storage tracking mechanism and  in case of changes fetch the list of events of interest.   The value has the type `(T::BlockNumber, EventIndex)` because if we used only just  the `EventIndex` then in case if the topic has the same contents on the next block  no notification will be triggered thus the event might be lost.

▸ **extrinsicCount**(): `Option<u32>`
- **summary**:   Total extrinsics count for the current block.

▸ **didUpdate**(): `bool`
- **summary**:   Did the timestamp get updated in this block?

▸ **minimumPeriod**(): `Moment`
- **summary**:   The minimum period between blocks. Beware that this is different to the *expected* period  that the block production apparatus provides. Your chosen consensus system will generally  work with this to determine a sensible block time. e.g. For Aura, it will be double this  period on default settings.

▸ **now**(): `Moment`
- **summary**:   Current time for the current block.

___


### treasury
