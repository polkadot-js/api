It handles all the encoding and decoding or parameters, provides access to RPC functions and allows for the query of chain state and the submission of transactions.\nThe API wrappers provide a standard interface for use -\n\nA static .create() that returns an API instance when connected, decorated and ready-to use\nThe above is just a wrapper for new Api(), exposing the isReady getter\napi.rpc.. provides access to actual RPC calls, be it for queries, submission or retrieving chain information\nRPC (node interface)\n\n\napi.query.. provides access to chain state queries. These are dynamically populated based on what the runtime provides\nStorage chain state (runtime node interface)\n\n\napi.tx.. provides the ability to create a transaction, like chain state, this list is populated from a runtime query\nExtrinsics (runtime node interface)\n\n\n\nAPI Selection\nThere are two flavours of the API provided, one allowing a standard interface via JavaScript Promises and the second provides an Observable wrapper using RxJS. Depending on your use-case and familiarity, you can choose either (or even both) for your application.\n\nApiPromise All interface calls returns Promises, including the static .create(...). Additionally any subscription method uses (value) => {} callbacks, returning the value as the subscription is updated.\nApiRx All interface calls return RxJS Observables, including the static .create(...). In the same fashion subscription-based methods return long-running Observables that update with the latest values.\n\nDynamic by default\nSubstrate (upon which Polkadot is built) uses on-chain WASM runtimes, allowing for upgradability. Each runtime defining the actual chain extrinsics (submitted transactions and block intrinsics) as well as available entries in the chain state. Due to this, the API endpoints for queries and transactions are dynamically populated from the running chain.\nDue to this dynamic nature, this API departs from traditional APIs which only has fixed endpoints, driving use by what is available by the runtime. As a start, this generic nature has a learning curve, although the provided documentation, examples and linked documentation tries to make that experience as seamless as possible.\nInstallation & import\nInstallation -\nnpm install --save @polkadot/api\nSubscribing to blocks via Promise-based API -\nimport { ApiPromise } from '@polkadot/api';\n\n// initialise via static create\nconst api = await ApiPromise.create();\n\n// make a call to retrieve the current network head\napi.rpc.chain.subscribeNewHead((header) => {\n  console.log(`Chain is at #${header.blockNumber}`);\n});\n\nSubscribing to blocks via RxJS-based API -\nimport { ApiRx } from '@polkadot/api';\n\n// initialise via static create\nconst api = await ApiRx.create().toPromise();\n\n// make a call to retrieve the current network head\napi.rpc.chain.subscribeNewHead().subscribe((header) => {\n  console.log(`Chain is at #${header.blockNumber}`);\n});\n\nUsers\nSome of the users of the API (let us know if you are missing from the list), include -\n\nPolkadot-JS UI A user-interface that allows you to make transactions, query the network or participate in actions on the network such as referendums and staking\nPolkabot Polkabot is a Matrix chatbot that keeps an eye on the Polkadot network.

As a full Observable API, all interface calls return RxJS Observables, including the static .create(...). In the same fashion and subscription-based methods return long-running Observables that update with the latest values.\nThe API is well suited to real-time applications where the latest state is needed, unlocking the subscription-based features of Polkadot (and Substrate) clients. Some familiarity with RxJS is a requirement to use the API, however just understanding .subscribe and .pipe on Observables will unlock full-scale use thereof.\nsee: ApiPromise\nUsage\nMaking rpc calls -  \nimport ApiRx from '@polkadot/api/rx';\n\n// initialise via Promise & static create\nconst api = await ApiRx.create().toPromise();\n\n// make a call to retrieve the current network head\napi.rpc.chain.subscribeNewHead().subscribe((header) => {\n  console.log(`Chain is at #${header.blockNumber}`);\n});\n\nSubscribing to chain state -  \nimport { combineLatest } from 'rxjs';\nimport { pairwise, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\nimport { ApiRx } from '@polkadot/api';\nimport { WsProvider } from '@polkadot/rpc-provider';\n\n// initialise a provider with a specific endpoint\nconst provider = new WsProvider('wss://example.com:9944')\n\n// initialise via isReady & new with specific provider\nnew ApiRx(provider)\n  .isReady\n  .pipe(\n    switchMap((api) =>\n      combineLatest([\n        api.query.timestamp.blockPeriod(),\n        api.query.timestamp.now().pipe(pairwise())\n      ])\n    )\n  )\n  .subscribe(([blockPeriod, timestamp]) => {\n     const elapsed = timestamp[1].toNumber() - timestamp[0].toNumber();\n     console.log(`timestamp ${timestamp[1]} \\nelapsed ${elapsed} \\n(${blockPeriod}s target)`);\n  });\n\nSubmitting a transaction -  \nimport { first, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\nimport ApiRx from '@polkadot/api/rx';\n\n// import the test keyring (already has dev keys for Alice, Bob, Charlie, Eve & Ferdie)\nimport testingPairs from '@polkadot/keyring/testingPairs';\nconst keyring = testingPairs();\n\n// get api via Promise\nconst api = await ApiRx.create().toPromise();\n\n// retrieve nonce for the account\napi.query.system\n  .accountNonce(keyring.alice.address())\n  .pipe(\n     first(),\n     // pipe nonce into transfer\n     switchMap((nonce) =>\n       api.tx.balances\n         // create transfer\n         .transfer(keyring.bob.address(), 12345)\n         // sign the transcation\n         .sign(keyring.alice, nonce)\n         // send the transaction\n         .send()\n     )\n  )\n  // subscribe to overall result\n  .subscribe(({ status, type }) => {\n    if (type === 'Finalised') {\n      console.log('Completed at block hash', status.asFinalised.toHex());\n    }\n  });\n\nHierarchy\n ApiBaseOnCall>\n↳ ApiRx\nImplements\n\nApiBaseInterfaceOnCall>\nApiRxInterface\n\nConstructors\n\nconstructor\n⊕ new ApiRx(provider?: ApiOptions | ProviderInterface): ApiRx\nOverrides ApiBase.constructor\nDefined in rx/index.ts:142\ndescription: Create an instance of the ApiRx class\nexample:   \nimport { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\nimport Api from '@polkadot/api/rx';\n\nnew Api().isReady\n  .pipe(\n    switchMap((api) =>\n      api.rpc.chain.subscribeNewHead()\n  ))\n  .subscribe((header) => {\n    console.log(`new block #${header.blockNumber.toNumber()}`);\n  });\n\nParameters:\n\n\n\nName\nType\n\n\n\n\nOptional provider\nApiOptions\nProviderInterface\n\n\n\nReturns: ApiRx\n\nAccessors\n\nderive\ngetderive(): DeriveOnCall>\nInherited from ApiBase.derive\nDefined in Base.ts:155\ndescription: Derived results that are injected into the API, allowing for combinations of various query results.\nexample:   \napi.derive.chain.bestNumber((number) => {\n  console.log('best number', number);\n});\n\nReturns: DeriveOnCall>\n\n\ngenesisHash\ngetgenesisHash(): Hash\nInherited from ApiBase.genesisHash\nDefined in Base.ts:112\ndescription: Contains the genesis Hash of the attached chain.

It is important that the constructor values matches 100% to the order in th Rust code, i.e. don't go crazy and make it alphabetical, it needs to decoded in the specific defined order.\nType parameters\nS :  ConstructorDef\nT :  object\nV :  object\nE :  object\nHierarchy\n Mapkeyof S, Codec>\n↳ Struct\n↳  CandidateReceipt\n↳  AttestedCandidate\n↳  FunctionArgumentMetadata\n↳  FunctionMetadata\n↳  CallMetadata\n↳  ModuleMetadata\n↳  StorageFunctionType$Map\n↳  StorageFunctionMetadata\n↳  StorageMetadata\n↳  RuntimeModuleMetadata\n↳  Method\n↳  SignaturePayload\n↳  ExtrinsicSignature\n↳  Extrinsic\n↳  Digest\n↳  Header\n↳  Block\n↳  OuterDispatchCall\n↳  OuterDispatchMetadata\n↳  EventMetadata\n↳  OuterEventMetadata\n↳  Metadata\n↳  Event\n↳  EventRecord\n↳  Health\n↳  KeyValue\n↳  BftAtReport\n↳  BftProposeOutOfTurn\n↳  MisbehaviorReport\n↳  RhdJustification\n↳  PeerInfo\n↳  ReferendumInfo\n↳  RuntimeVersion\n↳  SignedBlock\n↳  StorageChangeSet\n↳  StoredPendingChange\n↳  ValidatorPrefs\nImplements\n\nCodec\n\nConstructors\n\nconstructor\n⊕ new Struct(Types: S, value?: V | Mapany, any> | Arrayany>, jsonMap?: Mapkeyof S, string>): Struct\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:31\nParameters:\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDefault value\n\n\n\n\nTypes\nS\n-\n\n\nDefault value value\nV\nMapany, any>\nArrayany>\n{} as V\n\n\nDefault value jsonMap\nMapkeyof S, string>\nnew Map()\n\n\n\nReturns: Struct\n\nProperties\n\n Map\n● Map: MapConstructor\nDefined in /home/travis/build/polkadot-js/api/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es2015.collection.d.ts:36\n\nAccessors\n\nType\ngetType(): E\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:142\ndescription: Returns the Type description to sthe structure\nReturns: E\n\n\nencodedLength\ngetencodedLength(): number\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:149\ndescription: The length of the value when encoded as a Uint8Array\nReturns: number\n\nMethods\n\neq\n▸ eq(other?: any): boolean\nImplementation of Codec.eq\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:158\ndescription: Compares the value of the input to see if there is a match\nParameters:\n\n\n\nName\nType\n\n\n\n\nOptional other\nany\n\n\n\nReturns: boolean\n\n\nget\n▸ get(name: keyof S): Codec | undefined\nOverrides Map.get\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:166\ndescription: Returns a specific names entry in the structure\nParameters:\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nkeyof S\nThe name of the entry to retrieve\n\n\n\nReturns: Codec | undefined\n\n\ngetAtIndex\n▸ getAtIndex(index: number): Codec\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:173\ndescription: Returns the values of a member at a specific index (Rather use get(name) for performance)\nParameters:\n\n\n\nName\nType\n\n\n\n\nindex\nnumber\n\n\n\nReturns: Codec\n\n\ntoArray\n▸ toArray(): ArrayCodec>\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:180\ndescription: Converts the Object to an standard JavaScript Array\nReturns: ArrayCodec>\n\n\ntoHex\n▸ toHex(): string\nImplementation of Codec.toHex\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:187\ndescription: Returns a hex string representation of the value\nReturns: string\n\n\ntoJSON\n▸ toJSON(): any\nImplementation of Codec.toJSON\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:194\ndescription: Converts the Object to JSON, typically used for RPC transfers\nReturns: any\n\n\ntoString\n▸ toString(): string\nImplementation of Codec.toString\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:208\ndescription: Returns the string representation of the value\nReturns: string\n\n\ntoU8a\n▸ toU8a(isBare?: undefined | false | true): Uint8Array\nImplementation of Codec.toU8a\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:216\ndescription: Encodes the value as a Uint8Array as per the parity-codec specifications\nParameters:\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nOptional isBare\nundefined\nfalse\ntrue\ntrue when the value has none of the type-specific prefixes (internal)\n\n\n\nReturns: Uint8Array\n\n\n with\n▸ withS>(Types: S): ConstructorStructS>>\nDefined in codec/Struct.ts:122\nType parameters:\nS :  ConstructorDef\nParameters:\n\n\n\nName\nType\n\n\n\n\nTypes\nS\n\n\n\nReturns: ConstructorStructS>>\n\n"},"types/classes/_codec_tuple_.tuple.html":{"url":"types/classes/_codec_tuple_.tuple.html","title":"hidden","keywords":"","body":"name: Tuple\ndescription: A Tuple defines an anonymous fixed-length array, where each element has its own type.
