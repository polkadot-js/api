# Getting started

These sections should provide you with all the information needed to install the `@polkadot/api` package, understand the structure of the interfaces and allow you to start using it. For existing users this really should be titled "Things I wish I knew before I started using the api" - it really aims to close the gap to allow anybody to get to grips with using the packages.

## What this is not

This is not line-by-line documentation of all the existing function calls available, nor it is tied to a specific chain. (Although the examples do refer to the base Polkadot & Substrate chains). There will be some things in the API that are probably not covered, which brings us to the next point...

## Help us help others

If you spot gaps in the information provided, or are uncertain about any specific area, please do [log an issue](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api/issues) or if you are that way inclined, make a pull-request. We really want to have good documentation in these areas and allow people to be productive right from the start.

## Ready? Steady? Go!

If you already have a good grasp on the API and are just looking for a specific answer, you may want to take a look at the [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.md). With all that said, let's get started... [What should be installed, and how should we do it?](install.md)
