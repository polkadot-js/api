# Getting started

These sections should provide you will all the information needed to install the `@polkadot/api` package, understand the structure of the interfaces and allow you to start using it. For existing users this really should be titled "Things I wish I knew before I started using the api" - it really aims to close the gap to allow anybody to get to grips with using the packages.

## Help us help others

If you spot gaps in the information provided, or are uncertain about any specific area, please do [log an issue](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api/issues) or if you are that way inclined, make a pull-requst. We really want to have good documentation in these areas and allow people to be productive right from the start.

## Ready? Steady? Go!
