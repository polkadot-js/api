# TypeScript interfaces

The API is written in TypeScript, and as such definitions for all actual exposed interfaces are available. In general terms, care has been taken to expose types via a `@polkadot/<package>/types` interface, for instance the `ApiOptions` type which is passed through on the `.create` interface is available under `@polkadot/api/types`.

## RPC interfaces

Before getting to the "hard things", i.e. methods as decorated based on metadata interfaces, let's take a look at more "static" interfaces such as RPC. (Be aware though that these can be customized on a per-chain basis as well - for now this functionality is not reflected in the API itself).

```js
import { Header } from '@polkadot/types/interfaces';

...
const firstHead = api.rpc.chain.getHeader();

api.rpc.chain.subscribeNewHeads((lastHead: Header): void => {
  console.log('current header:', JSON.stringify(lastHead));
});
```

In the above example a couple of things are introduced - most of the chain definitions (the default types for both Polkadot & Substrate) can be imported as interfaces from the `@polkadot/types/interfaces` endpoint. These are not classes (since they are [generated from definitions](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api/tree/master/packages/types/src/interfaces)) but rather a combination of TypeScript `interfaces` (where structures are involved) and `type`, i.e. `type Balance = u128`.

In the subscription example, we explicitly define `lastHead: Header`, although the same definition is missing for `firstHead`. However, in both these cases the definitions for the `api.rpc` sections are such that TypeScript understands that `firstHead` and `lastHead` are of type `Header`. The `: Header` here is rather for our own understanding (and could be needed based on your eslint/tslint config).

As indicated, most of the Polkadot/Substrate default types are available via `types/interfaces`. However, for primitives types where there is an actual implementation, these are made available via `@polkadot/types` directly. For instance, `import { u32 } from '@polkadot/types` is valid in this context.

## Metadata injected

For any interface injected by metadata, the types are not available by default (although it may be in the future for default interfaces), but rather what the API understands is that all results need to comply to the `Codec` interface. (The base of all our types)

However, to make this sane from a developer perspective the injected methods are generic, effectively making the following possible -

```js
import { AccountData, Index } from '@polkadot/types/interfaces';

...
const [nonce, balance] = await api.query.system.account<[Index, AccountData]>(ADDR);
```

In both these case we can instruct the TypeScript compiler that the type we are expecting in `Index` and `Balance` respectively, not just pure `Codec`. This means that functions like `.toNumber()` is available on both these types - as opposed to just the [general type defaults](types.basics.md#everything-is-a-type) with `.toHex()` and friends.

## Future work

As of this writing, there are still some gray areas to type detection, specifically around the following interfaces -

- `.at` & `.multi` on `api.query` does not (yet) have a `<TypeOverride>` interface. This means `as <TypeOverride>` casts are presently needed for these results
- `api.queryMulti` does not (yet) allow you to provide a hint to the types returned, this ties to the previous point

## Adding user types

In addition to the generated and available interfaces, there is also the ability to [create TypeScript interfaces from your own definitions and well as your on-chain modules](typescript.user.md).
