       * The dispatch origin for this call can be either `RejectOrigin`, or
       * the curator of the parent bounty, or any signed origin.
       * 
       * For the origin other than T::RejectOrigin and the child-bounty
       * curator, parent bounty must be in active state, for this call to
       * work. We allow child-bounty curator and T::RejectOrigin to execute
       * this call irrespective of the parent bounty state.
       * 
       * If this function is called by the `RejectOrigin` or the
       * parent bounty curator, we assume that the child-bounty curator is
       * malicious or inactive. As a result, child-bounty curator deposit is
       * slashed.
       * 
       * If the origin is the child-bounty curator, we take this as a sign
       * that they are unable to do their job, and are willingly giving up.
       * We could slash the deposit, but for now we allow them to unreserve
       * their deposit and exit without issue. (We may want to change this if
       * it is abused.)
       * 
       * Finally, the origin can be anyone iff the child-bounty curator is
       * "inactive". Expiry update due of parent bounty is used to estimate
       * inactive state of child-bounty curator.
       * 
       * This allows anyone in the community to call out that a child-bounty
       * curator is not doing their due diligence, and we should pick a new
       * one. In this case the child-bounty curator deposit is slashed.
