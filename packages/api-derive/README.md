# @polkadot/api-derive

Collection of high-level utility functions built on top of the @polkadot/api library. Designed to simplify the process of querying complex on-chain data by combining multiple RPC calls, storage queries, and runtime logic into a single, callable function.

Instead of manually fetching and processing blockchain data, developers can use `api.derive` methods to retrieve information.
