A breaking change was introduced by substrate runtime spec version 97. https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/2911/files

The change had to be implemented in ink! which changed the structure of the Wasm files.
That's why we need two different versions of the generated contract files.

Contract files before the breaking change can be found in the folder `contracts<spec_version-97`
Contract files compiled with an ink! version after the  breaking change are located here: `contracts>=spec_version-97`

**Compatibility**
If the substrate version is older than this https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/2911 it will only work
with contracts generated by an ink! version prior to https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/129 and vice versa.
