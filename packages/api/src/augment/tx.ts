       * 1. Its claimed score is equal to the score computed on-chain.

       * 3. All indexes must be value according to the snapshot vectors. All edge values must
       * also be correct and should not overflow the granularity of the ratio type (i.e. 256

       * 4. For each edge, all targets are actually nominated by the voter.

       * A solutions score is consisted of 3 parameters:

       * 2. `sum { support.total }` for each support of a winner. This value should be minimized.
