# @polkadot/api

The Polkadot-JS API provides easy-to-use wrappers around JSONRPC calls that flow from an application to a node. It handles all the encoding and decoding or parameters, provides access to RPC functions and allows for the query of chain state and the submission of transactions.

The API wrappers provide a standard interface for use -

- A static `.create(<optional WsProvider>)` that returns an API istance when connected, decorated and ready-to use
- The above is just a wrapper for `new Api(<optional WsProvider>) `, exposing the `isReady` getter
- `api.rpc.*` provides access to actual RPC calls, be it for queries, submission or retrieving chain information
- `api.st.*` provides access to chain state queries. These are dynamically populated based on what the runtime provides
- `api.tx.*` provides the ability to create transaction, like chain state, this list is populated from a runtime query

## API Selection

There are two flavours of the API provided, one allowing a standard interface via JavaScript Promises and the second provides an Observable wrapper using [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs). Depending on your use-case and familiarity, you can choose either (or even both) for your application.

- [ApiPromise](promise/) All interface calls returns Promises, including the static `.create(...)`. Additionally any subscription method use standard JavaScript `(error, value) => {}` callbacks.
- [ApiRx](rx/) All interface calls return RxJS Observables, including the static `.create(...)`. In the same fashion and subscription-based methods return long-running Observables that update with the latest values.

## Installation & import

Installation -

```
npm install --save @polkadot/api/rx
```

Subscribing to blocks via Promise-based API -

```javascript
import { ApiPromise } from '@polkadot/api';

// initialise via static create
const api = await ApiPromise.create();

// make a call to retrieve the current network head
api.rpc.chain.newHead((error, header) => {
  console.log(`Chain is at #${header.blockNumber}`);
});
```

Subscribing to blocks via RxJS-based API -

```javascript
import { ApiRx } from '@polkadot/api';

// initialise via static create
const api = await ApiRx.create().toPromise();

// make a call to retrieve the current network head
api.rpc.chain.newHead().subscribe((header) => {
  console.log(`Chain is at #${header.blockNumber}`);
});
```

## Users

Some of the users of the API (let us know if you are missing from the list), include -

- [Polkadot-JS UI](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps) A user-interface that allows you to make transactions, query the network or participate in actions on the network such as referendums and staking
- [Polkabot](https://gitlab.com/Polkabot) Polkabot is a Matrix chatbot that keeps an eye on the Polkadot network. You can see Polkabot in action in https://matrix.to/#/#polkadot-network-status:matrix.org
